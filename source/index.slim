    h2 Pure CSS Speech Bubbles
    h3 Posted on September 4th 2013

      ' Speech bubbles are a pretty common pattern in web design, especially for tooltip pop ups.
      ' Having to save out a small triangle shape and attach it to the outside of the rounded
      ' speech bubble are can become a bit cumbersome, so here is a way to create one from pure CSS.
    p
      ' As always, we'll start off with some simple markup and transform it into our speech bubble using
      ' CSS rounded corners and pseudo elements.
    pre
      .code-wrap
        code data-language="html"
          ' <div class="speech-bubble">
              <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing 
                elit. Duis sed sapien ultricies enim elementum porttitor 
                at mattis mi. Cras vehicula.
              </p>
            </div>
    p
      ' The above HTML is about as simple as a markup pattern can get. Feel free to optionally add a header element with
      ' an h1 or h2 in it to create some heading text.
    p
      ' Next up, were going to add our CSS, this will include an absolutely positioned pseudo-element with a unicode
      ' triangle character as it's content.
    pre
      .code-wrap
        code data-language="css"
          ' .speech-bubble {
              width: 25%;
              background: #fff;
              border-radius: 10px;
              border: 1px solid #ccc;
              padding: 10px;
              position: relative;
            }

            .speech-bubble:after {
              content: '\25bc';
              position: absolute;
              bottom: -17px;
              right: 18px;
              color: #fff;
              text-shadow: 1px 1px 0 #ccc, -1px 1px 0 #ccc;
            }

    p
      ' The only slight issue I see with this solution, is the fact that the arrow (having used text-shadow to
      ' create the faux border) doesn't look exactly pointed at the bottom, but it's not a totally noticeable
      ' issue.

    p
      ' Keep in mind you can always use an arrow pointing in a different direction. Then, with the absolute positioning
      ' you can change the location of it relative to the bubble container.
